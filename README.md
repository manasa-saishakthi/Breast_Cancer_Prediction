# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells, leading to tumor development. The incidence of breast cancer is rising significantly, making it a major public health concern, especially among women. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing a predictive model for breast cancer using various machine learning (ML) techniques. By leveraging algorithms like Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and XGBoost, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of cancer stage prediction and overall treatment strategies.

## Methodology

### Feature Selection

- **Objective**: Identify and select the most relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance.
- **Approach**: Utilize feature selection techniques to enhance model accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### Machine Learning Models

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**: A statistical model used for binary classification problems.
- **Random Forest Classifier (RF)**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: A neural network model that mimics the human brain's neural connections for complex pattern recognition.
- **XGBoost Algorithm**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that provides high performance and accuracy.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
